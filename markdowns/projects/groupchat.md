This project is a simple group chat application written in JAVA programming language. Registered users can broadcast message so all the other registered users can see the message, or they can chat with one designated user privately where other users will not see the message.

This is a student computer networks programming project. The project is using JAVA socket library to create a multi users chat application (one-to-all and one-to-one).
