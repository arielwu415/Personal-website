Alimentation is an online grocery shopping webservice designed for both customers and drivers. It aims to combine the services of [Uber Eats](https://www.ubereats.com/) and [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/). Users can sign up as customers, order from various grocery stores, get their order delivered to their place. They can also choose to be drivers, pick up and deliver orders for the customers.

This is a student software engineering project. It progressed in **SCRUM** methodology where professor was the client, and students were the service providers. Daily meetings with fellow students and weekly meetings with clients were required. The frontend of this project uses Next.js framework, which has a lot of intuitive and useful features and allows developers to build their frontend more easily. The backend uses Firebase/Firestore, which is a NoSQL Realtime database where data is stored in collections of documents.
