Gnome Sorting Machine sorts the input numbers with gnome sort algorithm and prints out the results with step by step explination. It shows the numbers in a form of array with textual explination indicating the pivot and numbers swapped.

It is the first JavaScript project that I have ever built in 2021 for learning purposes. It aims to learn how JavaScript functions manipulate the HTML objects. It takes user input in a text box and sort function will be called when users press the enter button. It will also update the HTML when the button is pressed.
