JUST US is my earliest portfolio website for a **Frontend Engineering** class in 2016. In the project, another student and I created a website for our biography, arts, photography, and proses.

This portfolio was built using HTML and CSS. Without JavaScript involved, it mainly focused on the visual presentation of the website. We started it from scratch, not using any frameworks or models. We followed the sitemap created prior to the implementation and took all the pictures we needed on our own.
