StudySite is a webservice that accompanies users when they want to be focused and productive. It provides lofi music with natural sounds, and it has a timer that users can break their study or work sessions into intervals. The website goes by three mottos Stay Organized, Stay Motivative, Stay Focused.

This is a student project for learning JavaScript language in application of real world project. The other four students and I choose to build this website using a popular JavaScript framework in the industry, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). In addition to building a static website, I suggested to add some animations to make it more appealing to users, and give us a chance to see how powerful JavaScript is. The animation library that this project uses is [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/).
